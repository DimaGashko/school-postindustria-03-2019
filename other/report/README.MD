My name is Dmitry Gashko. Write now I'm a student at
Admiral Makarov National University of Shipbuilding (software engineering; in second year).

I love programming... in fact, I'm crazy about programming (look at my GitHub profile). I only started my developer way and I have to learn so much cool things.

There's a list of technologies I know.

By the University:

- C++ (SFML)
- Java (JavaFX, FXML, JFoenix)
- Some knowledge of OOP
- SQL (only basics)

Other:

- JavaScript & TypeScript (I love both, but TS more)
- HTML (Pug), CSS (SASS) - I like preprocessors
- Webpack, Gulp (and Grunt...), GIT, GitGub,
- Canvas 2d, WebComponents (basics), jQuery...

There are some of my projects:
[github.com/DimaGashko/ListOfMyProjects](https://github.com/DimaGashko/ListOfMyProjects)

Also I had been working as a freelance JS Developer: [weblancer.net/users/DimaGashko/](https://www.weblancer.net/users/DimaGashko/)

Of course I prefer Web Development.
