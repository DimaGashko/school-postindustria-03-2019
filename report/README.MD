My name is Dmitry Gashko. Right now I'm a student at
Admiral Makarov National University of Shipbuilding (software engineering; in second year).

I love programming... in fact, I'm crazy about programming (look at my GitHub profile). I only started my developer way and I have to learn so much cool things.

There's a list of technologies I know.

By the University:

- C++ (SFML)
- Java (JavaFX, FXML, JFoenix)
- Some knowledge of OOP
- SQL (basics only)

Other:

- JavaScript & TypeScript (I love both, but TS more)
- HTML (Pug), CSS (SASS) - I like preprocessors
- Webpack, Gulp (and Grunt...), GIT, GitHub,
- Canvas 2d, WebComponents (basics), jQuery...

I have No knowledge in back-end technologies (I only can recognize php code from code in other languages).

There are some of my projects:
[github.com/DimaGashko/ListOfMyProjects](https://github.com/DimaGashko/ListOfMyProjects)

Also I had been working as a freelance JS Developer: [weblancer.net/users/DimaGashko/](https://www.weblancer.net/users/DimaGashko/)

Of course I prefer Web Development.

## About my English skills

I really like English, but my English skills is not so good. Anyway I can
learn from English sources. All technologies that I learnt by the last year I was learning only by official documentation, english articles and english YouTube (for example: SFML, JavaFX, JFoenix, basics of SQL, Webpack etc).

That's definitely means that my listening skills is not too bad. But speaking and writing skills a little behind.
